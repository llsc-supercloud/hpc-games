# Materials List for The Scheduler Game

The materials for a single game are listed below. The bulk of the materials can be purchased from the Lego webpage.

## The Lego Pieces

The pieces for The Scheduler Game can be purchased through [Lego's Pick a Brick](https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/static/pick-a-brick) page. Note that the Pick a Brick orders can take roughly 20 business days, so you will want to order early. This list costs roughly $30 as is to purchase and ship in the US. Colors are not necessarily important, as long as all the bricks representing a particular job type are roughly the same color. This helps distinguish them from each other. We encourage you to pick your pieces to reflect the job types for your system, and select nodes that reflect your system. Feel free to get creative!

## Other Materials

- Business card paper or heavy cardstock to print out cards. Two-toned paper works well to distinguish front and back. Paper can be used in a pinch.
- String or cord to tie distributed jobs together. Thicker cord or yarn works best to prevent tangling.
- A die (or die rolling app)
- Trays to hold the job pieces (optional). Small paper plates work well, you can write the job names on them!
